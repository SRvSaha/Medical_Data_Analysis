 k-fold cross-validation in weka
=================================

Since we're using 10 fold cross-validation for our data, so here is the scenerio described in layman terms.
Basically we are doing supervised learning in our dataset using cross-validation.

So, here is the scenario again: you have 100 labeled data

Use training set

-    weka will take 100 labeled data
-   it will apply an algorithm to build a classifier from these 100 data
-   it applies that classifier AGAIN on these 100 data
-   it provides you with the performance of the classifier (applied to the same 100 data from which it was developed)

Use 10 fold CV

    Weka takes 100 labeled data

-   it produces 10 equal sized sets. Each set is divided into two groups: 90 labeled data are used for training and 10 labeled
    data are used for testing.

-   it produces a classifier with an algorithm from 90 labeled data and applies that on the 10 testing data for set 1.

-   It does the same thing for set 2 to 10 and produces 9 more classifiers

-   it averages the performance of the 10 classifiers produced from 10 equal sized (90 training and 10 testing) sets
