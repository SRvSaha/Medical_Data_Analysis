**Description**
===============

[1]. Machine Learning Analysis using Weka : The given dataset consisting of EMR (Electronic Medical Record)
     records in CSV(comma separated values) format is analyzed using Unsupervised Machine Learning
     Technique with 10-fold cross validation. Classification/Prediction is done on the basis of 2 classes :

     a. Predicting Drug Class - Butrans/Opana
     b. Predicting Type of Patient - Frequent Buyer/ Non-Frequent Buyer

     a. Predicting Drug Class - For the classification of Drug Class, I have taken into account 6 features
        to identify which drug ( Butrans or Opana ) a patient is likely to opt for.
        Features :
                    i. SEX
                    ii. AGE_GROUP
                    iii. REGION
                    iv. CATAGORY
                    v. REFILL_COUNT
                    vi. ADMISSION_TYPE
        Statistical analysis is done for 4 Machine Learning Algorithms using Weka :
            i. Random Forest : 64.32% correctly identified.
            ii. Decision Forest (j48) : 64.22% correctly identified.
            iii. Logistic Regression : 62.03% correctly identified.
            iv. SMO(Linear) : 61.33% correctly identified.

        Baseline metric was 58.0124 % as majority class was Opana (64428/111059).

     b. Predicting Frequent/Non-frequent Buyer : To predict whether a patient is a Frequent Buyer (F) or
        Non-Frequent Buyer (NF), I used 6 features as follows :
            Features :
                        i. SEX
                        ii. AGE_GROUP
                        iii. REGION
                        iv. CATAGORY
                        v. CLASS_DRUG
                        vi. ADMISSION_TYPE
        Firstly, I found out the mean of the refill count from our entire dataset which came out to be
        7.67. So, I've tagged all those patient as Frequent Buyer (F) whose REFILL_COUNT is greater than
        or equal to the mean, and the others I've tagged as Non-Frequent Buyer (NF).

        After this, using those 4 machine learning algorithms in Weka, I have done statistical analysis
        about the correctness. Almost all the algorithms gave ~97% accuracy since the baseline was 97%
        as maximum patients were falling in the NF category (1018451/1048575).

        TODO : Add the percentages after re-evaluation. Cross-validation of the algorithms are in progress.

            i. Random Forest :
            ii. Decision Forest (j48) :
            iii. Logistic Regression :
            iv. SMO(Linear) : 97.1271 %

[2]. Frequent Itemsets ( Apriori Algorithm ) and Cross-Validation using Male to Female ratio : We've used
     the Apriori Algorithm for finding out the frequent itemsets which appear together in our dataset.
     Since our dataset had 15 diagnosis codes and 15 procedure codes, so using Apriori Algorithm I filtered
     out those itemsets who occur together frequently in the dataset given a support and a confidence value.
     After lots of analysis, I figured out that overall 15 rules are generated with a support value of 0.01
     and confidence score of 0.99. So, to validate these rules with our original dataset i.e, the filter out
     the rules which reflect our original data in dataset I have taken into account the ENROLL_ID & SEX attributes in the dataset. I've written up a script in Python that could give me the ratio of Male to
     Female patients after removing the duplicated ENROL_IDs.

     Male:Female Ratio of Original Dataset came out to be : 0.61408

     To cross-validate the rules obtained I've written another Python script that takes the rules one by
     one as input and checks for the Male:Female ratio in original dataset. If the ratio Male:Female
     reflected by the rule has upto 9% error I've accepted it and concluded that the rule is perfectly
     reflecting our dataset.

     So, after doing this, I've obtained 2 rules finally at ~8.5% error rate :
        (99232, V6284) => ('') [Confidence : 99.5%] & (99223, V6284) => ('') [Confidence : 99.7%]

     With these 2 rules, finally 2470 results were obtained from our dataset that are frequent.

[3]. Analysis and Report on why kdb+ is better for medical data analysis in comparison to other databases :
     I've prepared a report on kdb+ after doing lots of analysis from various resources as to why is kdb+
     used when there are a bunch of other scalable open source databases out there in the market. Also, in
     the report comparative analysis of kdb+ is done with the most popular databases like MongoDB, NoSQL,
     and Hadoop since we're dealing with Big Datasets.
