#Winter Internship Project @ ACS Lab, IIT Mandi#
**Duration** : `1st Dec'16 to 31st Jan'17`
----
*Predictive Data Analysis, Data Mining and Machine Learning and Big Data are the key concepts of the project.*

The main goal of the project is to identify from EMR Datasets which patient is likely to buy which medicine using Machine Learning Techniques. Also, what is the chance of the patient in switching from one medicine to other. Even it is to be determined whether the patient is a frequent buyer or not.
### Machine Learning###
Prediction/Classification is to be done in two ways : 
 1.  Predicting __Class__ - Butrans / Opana : __Random Forest__ is the most accurate. __LibSVM__ is with least error
 2.  Predicting __Type of Patient__ : Frequent Buyer / Infrequent Buyer : __Random Forest__ is the most accurate. __LibSVM__ is with least error
 > Frequency is based on refill count
 > Median of refill count is used to separate F and NF  

 * __Weka__

  -  [x]  Random Forest
  -  [x]  Decision Tree
  -  [x]  Bagging on Decision Tree
